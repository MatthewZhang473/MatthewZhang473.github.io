# Files Directory

This directory is for storing your resume, CV, and other documents that you want to make available for download on your academic homepage.

## How to use:

1. **Resume/CV**: Upload your resume and CV as PDF files named:
   - `resume.pdf` - for your general resume
   - `cv.pdf` - for your detailed curriculum vitae

2. **Other documents**: You can also store other academic documents here such as:
   - Research statements
   - Teaching statements
   - Publication PDFs
   - Presentation slides

## File naming recommendations:

- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens instead of spaces
- Examples: `research-statement.pdf`, `teaching-philosophy.pdf`, `dissertation-abstract.pdf`

## Updating links:

After uploading files, make sure to update the corresponding links in the `index.html` file to point to the correct file paths.

## Security note:

Only upload files that you want to be publicly accessible, as GitHub Pages serves all files publicly.
